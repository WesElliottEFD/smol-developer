# Build Process and Dependency Management

## Build Procedures

The build process for our application, which is aimed at enhancing user engagement at events, is designed to be automated, consistent, and reproducible. We use `BuildAutomationTools` to ensure that our application is built and deployed efficiently.

### Automated Build Pipeline

Our build pipeline consists of several stages:

1. **Initialization**: Set up the necessary environment variables and check for the availability of required services.
2. **Dependency Installation**: Use the `DependencyList` to install all the necessary dependencies for the project.
3. **Compilation**: Compile the source code using the appropriate compiler for our technology stack.
4. **Testing**: Run the `TestSuiteNames` to ensure that all the new changes pass the existing tests.
5. **Packaging**: Package the compiled code into deployable artifacts, such as JAR or WAR files for Java applications.
6. **Deployment**: Deploy the artifacts to the appropriate environment, whether it be staging or production.

### Dependency Management

We manage our application dependencies using a dependency management tool appropriate for our technology stack. The `DependencyList` is maintained in a file such as `pom.xml` for Maven (Java), `requirements.txt` for Python, or `package.json` for Node.js.

### Continuous Integration

We use a continuous integration (CI) server to automate the build and testing process. The CI server monitors our version control system for changes and triggers a new build with each commit to the main branch.

### Build Scripts

Below is a pseudo-code representation of our build script:

```plaintext
initialize_environment()
install_dependencies(DependencyList)
compile_source()
run_tests(TestSuiteNames)
package_artifacts()
deploy_to_environment()
```

### Versioning

We adhere to semantic versioning to manage the versions of our application. Each build is tagged with a unique version number that indicates the type of changes included (major, minor, or patch).

### Build Artifacts Storage

All build artifacts are stored in a secure artifact repository, which allows for easy rollback to previous versions if necessary.

### Monitoring and Notifications

The build process is monitored, and the team is notified of build statuses through email, Slack, or other messaging tools.

### Documentation

The build process is documented in `BuildProcedures.md`, and any changes to the build process are reflected in this document. The `DocumentationFileNames` convention is followed to ensure consistency.

## Conclusion

Our build process is a critical component of our software development lifecycle. It ensures that our application, designed for enhancing user engagement at events, is built and deployed in a reliable and efficient manner. By following the practices outlined above, we maintain a high standard of software quality and facilitate continuous delivery.
