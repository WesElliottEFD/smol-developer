## Naming Conventions

- Each Markdown file is named to reflect its content and the section of the analysis it pertains to.
- Filenames are in PascalCase to maintain consistency and readability.

## Maintenance Strategy

- Regular maintenance of the documentation is scheduled on a bi-weekly basis.
- During maintenance, the documentation is reviewed for accuracy and updated to reflect any changes in the codebase.
- Any new features or architectural changes are documented promptly to keep the documentation current.

## Collaboration and Progress Tracking

- The documentation is shared and updated using [specify tool/platform], which allows for collaborative editing and version control.
- Deadlines for each section of the analysis are tracked using the project management features of the specified tool/platform.

## Documentation Review

- The accuracy of the documentation is periodically reviewed by the development team.
- Feedback from the team is incorporated to improve the clarity and comprehensiveness of the documentation.

By adhering to this organization strategy, we ensure that the documentation remains a valuable resource for current and future development efforts, facilitating a clear understanding of the application's architecture and design.
