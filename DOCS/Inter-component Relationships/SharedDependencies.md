# Shared Dependencies

This document outlines the shared dependencies within the application, focusing on how these dependencies are used across different components and their implications for maintainability.

## Application Overview

Refer to [Overview.md](../Introduction/Overview.md) for a comprehensive understanding of the application's goals, audience, and technology stack. This section provides context for the shared dependencies and their relevance to the application's core functionality.

## Data Model Schema

The `DataModelSchema` is crucial for the Entities, Use Cases, and Interface Adapters. It ensures that data is consistently managed and transformed across these components. For detailed schema definitions, see [Entities.md](../Core%20Business%20Logic/Entities.md).

## Business Logic Functions

`BusinessLogicFunctions` are implemented in the Entities and are invoked by the Use Cases to perform core application operations. These functions are documented in [Entities.md](../Core%20Business%20Logic/Entities.md) and [UseCases.md](../Business%20Processes/UseCases.md).

## Use Case Descriptions

The `UseCaseDescriptions` provide a narrative of the business processes and how they interact with the business logic. They are integral to the Use Cases and Testing Methods. For more information, refer to [UseCases.md](../Business%20Processes/UseCases.md).

## Interface Component Names

`InterfaceComponentNames` are used within the Interface Adapters to ensure a consistent user experience and data presentation. These components are also subject to security and testing considerations. Documentation can be found in [InterfaceAdapters.md](../Data%20Conversion%20and%20User%20Interface/InterfaceAdapters.md).

## API Endpoints

`APIEndpoints` are defined within the Frameworks and Drivers and are essential for external communication. They must be secured and tested thoroughly. Details are available in [FrameworksAndDrivers.md](../External%20Communication/FrameworksAndDrivers.md).

## Security Protocol Names

`SecurityProtocolNames` are the mechanisms used to protect user data and ensure secure access. These protocols are implemented across various components and are detailed in [SecurityProtocols.md](../Security%20and%20Authentication/SecurityProtocols.md).

## Test Suite Names

`TestSuiteNames` are critical for ensuring the application's reliability and performance. They are referenced in the Testing Methods and may interact with Use Cases and Interface Adapters. For more information, see [TestingMethods.md](../Testing%20and%20Quality%20Assurance/TestingMethods.md).

## Build Automation Tools

`BuildAutomationTools` are used to streamline the build process. They are referenced in the Build Procedures and may have implications for the Frameworks and Drivers. Documentation is provided in [BuildProcedures.md](../Build%20Process%20and%20Dependency%20Management/BuildProcedures.md).

## Dependency List

The `DependencyList` includes all application dependencies that are managed to ensure smooth build and deployment processes. This list is maintained in [BuildProcedures.md](../Build%20Process%20and%20Dependency%20Management/BuildProcedures.md) and [SharedDependencies.md](./SharedDependencies.md).

## Shared Library Names

`SharedLibraryNames` are the libraries or components that are used across different parts of the application. Their usage is documented in [SharedDependencies.md](./SharedDependencies.md) to ensure that any changes are consistently applied across the application.

## Documentation File Names

The `DocumentationFileNames` convention is applied to maintain consistency in documentation. This naming convention is outlined in [DocumentationOrganization.md](../Documentation%20Assembly%20and%20Organization/DocumentationOrganization.md).

## Supplementary Module Names

`SupplementaryModuleNames` refer to additional functional components or modules that enhance the application's capabilities. Their roles and interactions are documented in [SupplementaryFeatures.md](../Additional%20Functional%20Components/SupplementaryFeatures.md).

## Architectural Design Patterns

`ArchitecturalDesignPatterns` are the patterns or styles used throughout the application to promote clean architecture principles. These patterns are referenced across multiple documentation files to provide a unified understanding of the application's design.

## Maintenance Strategies

`MaintenanceStrategies` are procedures for keeping the documentation up to date with the codebase. These strategies are crucial for the ongoing accuracy of the documentation and are discussed in [DocumentationReview.md](../Documentation%20and%20Knowledge%20Sharing/DocumentationReview.md) and [DocumentationOrganization.md](../Documentation%20Assembly%20and%20Organization/DocumentationOrganization.md).

By documenting these shared dependencies, we aim to maintain a high level of coherence and maintainability within the application's architecture.
