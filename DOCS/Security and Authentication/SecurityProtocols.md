# Security Protocols

## Overview

This document outlines the security protocols and authentication measures implemented in the application designed for enhancing user engagement at events. The application is structured using Clean Architecture principles to ensure the security layer is independent and modular.

## Authentication

### User Authentication

- **Protocol**: OAuth 2.0
- **Implementation**: Users authenticate via third-party services. The application stores only the necessary tokens, not the user credentials.
- **Reference**: See `InterfaceComponentNames` for UI components related to authentication.

### Service Authentication

- **Protocol**: API Key and Secret
- **Implementation**: Services authenticate with an API key and secret that are managed through environment variables and not hard-coded into the application.
- **Reference**: Refer to `APIEndpoints` for details on services requiring authentication.

## Authorization

- **Method**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Implementation**: Users are assigned roles that determine their access levels within the application. The roles and permissions are defined in the `DataModelSchema`.

## Data Encryption

- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive data stored in the database.
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all data exchanged between the client and server.

## Security Audits

- **Frequency**: Quarterly
- **Procedure**: Automated and manual security audits are conducted, including code reviews and vulnerability scanning.
- **Reference**: Audit logs and reports are stored securely and reviewed as part of `TestingMethods`.

## Incident Response

- **Plan**: The application includes an incident response plan detailing steps for identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned.
- **Reference**: The full incident response plan can be found in `DocumentationFileNames`.

## Compliance

- **Standards**: The application complies with GDPR and other relevant data protection regulations.
- **Implementation**: Regular compliance checks and updates to security protocols are part of the maintenance strategy outlined in `MaintenanceStrategies`.

## Security Best Practices

- **Code Reviews**: All code changes undergo security-focused peer reviews.
- **Dependency Management**: Regular updates and audits of third-party libraries to mitigate vulnerabilities, as detailed in `DependencyList`.
- **Input Validation**: Strict input validation to prevent common security threats such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

## Conclusion

The security protocols and authentication measures are designed to protect user data and ensure secure operation of the application. Continuous monitoring and improvement of these protocols are essential to maintain the integrity and trustworthiness of the system.
