# Additional Functional Components

This section of the documentation focuses on the supplementary features that have been integrated into the application to enhance user engagement at events and track performance metrics in sports. These additional components are crucial for extending the functionality of the application beyond its core capabilities.

## Supplementary Module: Event Engagement Tracker

### Module Name: `EventEngagementTracker`

The `EventEngagementTracker` module is designed to monitor and analyze user interactions during events. It provides real-time analytics on user participation, feedback, and overall engagement levels.

#### Features:

- Real-time participation metrics
- Feedback collection and analysis
- Engagement level reporting

#### Dependencies:

- Refer to `DependencyList` in `DOCS/Build Process and Dependency Management/BuildProcedures.md`
- Utilizes `DataModelSchema` from `DOCS/Core Business Logic/Entities.md`
- Integrates with `APIEndpoints` defined in `DOCS/External Communication/FrameworksAndDrivers.md`

## Supplementary Module: Performance Metrics Analyzer

### Module Name: `PerformanceMetricsAnalyzer`

The `PerformanceMetricsAnalyzer` module is tailored for sports performance tracking. It aggregates data from various sensors and provides insightful analytics on athletes' performance.

#### Features:

- Sensor data aggregation
- Performance trend analysis
- Customizable metric reporting

#### Dependencies:

- Refer to `DependencyList` in `DOCS/Build Process and Dependency Management/BuildProcedures.md`
- Interacts with `BusinessLogicFunctions` from `DOCS/Core Business Logic/Entities.md`
- Connects to `APIEndpoints` for data retrieval as listed in `DOCS/External Communication/FrameworksAndDrivers.md`

## Future Considerations

As the application evolves, these modules should be regularly updated to incorporate new technologies and user feedback. Continuous integration and testing, as outlined in `TestSuiteNames` within `DOCS/Testing and Quality Assurance/TestingMethods.md`, will ensure that these components remain reliable and effective.

## Conclusion

The addition of the `EventEngagementTracker` and `PerformanceMetricsAnalyzer` modules significantly contributes to the application's value proposition. They enable a more comprehensive understanding of user engagement and athletic performance, which are central to the application's goals.
