Shared Dependencies:

1. `ApplicationOverview`: Information about the application's purpose, audience, and technology stack used across multiple documents for context.
2. `DataModelSchema`: The schema definitions for data models that are referenced in Entities, Use Cases, and Interface Adapters documentation.
3. `BusinessLogicFunctions`: Function names and descriptions that encapsulate the core business logic, shared between Entities and Use Cases documentation.
4. `UseCaseDescriptions`: Descriptions of business processes that are integrated with Entities and may be referenced in Interface Adapters and Testing Methods documentation.
5. `InterfaceComponentNames`: Names of UI components and data conversion utilities used in Interface Adapters, which may also be referenced in Security Protocols and Testing Methods.
6. `APIEndpoints`: Names and descriptions of external API endpoints used in Frameworks and Drivers, which may also be referenced in Security Protocols and Testing Methods.
7. `SecurityProtocolNames`: Names of security protocols and authentication mechanisms that are implemented across the application, referenced in Security and Authentication, and potentially in Use Cases and Interface Adapters.
8. `TestSuiteNames`: Names of test suites and testing methods that are used to ensure quality assurance, referenced in Testing Methods and potentially in Use Cases and Interface Adapters.
9. `BuildAutomationTools`: Names of tools and scripts used in the build process, referenced in Build Procedures and potentially in Frameworks and Drivers.
10. `DependencyList`: A list of application dependencies that are managed and referenced in Build Procedures and Shared Dependencies documentation.
11. `SharedLibraryNames`: Names of shared libraries or components that are used across different parts of the application, referenced in Shared Dependencies.
12. `DocumentationFileNames`: The naming convention for documentation files, which ensures consistency across the Documentation Assembly and Organization.
13. `SupplementaryModuleNames`: Names of additional functional components or modules that are part of the application, referenced in Supplementary Features.
14. `ArchitecturalDesignPatterns`: Names of design patterns or architectural styles used in the application, which may be referenced across multiple documentation files for consistency and understanding.
15. `MaintenanceStrategies`: Strategies or procedures for maintaining documentation, which may be referenced in Documentation Review and Documentation Organization.

These shared dependencies ensure consistency and coherence across the various sections of the documentation, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the application's architecture and facilitating future maintenance and development efforts.
