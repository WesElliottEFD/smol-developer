# DevFusion Team Briefing

## Introduction
This document serves as a briefing for the development team on the recent enhancements made to the DevFusion app, which was formerly known as Smol-Developer. Our objective has been to integrate UI elements from BloopAI, upgrade the AI model to GPT-4 Turbo, and update all references to the new name.

## 1. Renaming to DevFusion
- All instances of "Smol-Developer" have been updated to "DevFusion" across the entire codebase.
- Documentation, including README files and external documents, has been revised.
- Assets such as diagrams and screenshots have been updated to reflect the new name.

## 2. UI Component Integration from BloopAI
- React has been set up to match BloopAI's structure for the frontend framework.
- UI components from `client/src/` and `apps/desktop/src/` of BloopAI have been extracted and adapted.
- New custom components have been developed to ensure full feature parity with DevFusion's requirements.

## 3. Upgrading to GPT-4 Turbo
- The AI model has been upgraded to GPT-4 Turbo, replacing all instances of previous models.
- Context length parameters have been modified to take advantage of GPT-4 Turbo's capabilities.
- Backend compatibility has been ensured for handling the increased context lengths and complexity.

## 4. Testing and Validation
- Functionality testing has been conducted for each UI component.
- The performance of the GPT-4 Turbo model has been verified, with a focus on longer contexts.
- A thorough check for name consistency has been completed to ensure no references to the old name remain.
- The user experience has been validated against the new UI and AI model.

## 5. Documentation and Communication
- All project documentation has been updated to reflect the changes in UI, AI model upgrade, and name change.
- This briefing is part of the communication to keep the team and stakeholders informed.

## 6. Deployment
- The updated DevFusion app with the new UI and GPT-4 Turbo integration has been deployed.
- A monitoring system is in place post-deployment to track any issues or bugs.

## Additional Notes
- Code quality and documentation standards have been maintained throughout the integration process.
- A feedback loop has been established to collect user feedback on the new UI and functionalities.

## Action Items
- Review the updated [README.md](../README.md) and [installation_guide.md](installation_guide.md) for the latest setup instructions.
- Familiarize yourself with the new [user_guide.md](user_guide.md) to assist users effectively.
- Refer to the [api_reference.md](api_reference.md) for backend API changes.
- Use the [update_log.md](update_log.md) to track the chronological changes made during the upgrade process.
- Developers are encouraged to run [name_consistency_tests.py](../tests/name_consistency_tests.py) after any major code changes.
- Feedback from users can be collected using [feedback_collector.py](../../scripts/feedback_collector.py).

Please ensure that you are up to date with all the changes and continue to contribute to the success of DevFusion. Your hard work and dedication are greatly appreciated.
